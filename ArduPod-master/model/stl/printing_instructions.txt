Alternatively, instead of printing leg_segA,B and C, you can just print leg2.
However, that will require precisely calibrated printer. See the SolidWorks or SketchUp file for details.

Before printing, make sure that all the holes are the correct size. If you're using M3 bolts for the moving parts,
you will need the holes to have at least 3.25mm in diameter. The two bigger holes in leg2(_segA) are for the servo's gear axis.
Make sure their diameter is the same as the one of the gear axis on the servos you are using. 
In body_bottom, you will find rectangle-shaped holes for mounting the horizontal servos. 
Make sure they are big enough for the servos you will be using. To mount these servos, you will probably need to take them apart,
slide them in and reassemble them.
