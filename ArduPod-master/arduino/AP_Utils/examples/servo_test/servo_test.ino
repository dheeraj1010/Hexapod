/*
 * Servo test sketch
 * 
 * Used to calibrate the maximum and minimum boundaries for the servos.
 * It is absolutely necessary to run this example and calibrate the servos you will be using.
 * 
 * Calibration guide:
 * After uploading this example, the first servo (number 0) will sweep from the minimum to the maximum position.
 * You have to check whether it is reaching its physical limit.
 * The easiest way to do that is to disconnect power to the servo shield when the servo is in one of the limit positions.
 * With disconnected power, try to move the servo further in the direction it was moving before.
 * If it can still be moved, try to tweak the 'SERVOMIN' (or 'SERVOMAX') a little bit (about 10 at a time).
 * Do NOT try to move the servo beyond its physical limit, this might destroy your servo!
 * 
 * Brought into existence and debugged out of it by Gipsonek, 2016
